# Landing Page Project

Hey there! Welcome to my Landing Page project.

## What's this all about?

So, I'm working my way through The Odin Project's Foundations Course, and this is one of the cool projects they've thrown my way. Basically, they've given me a design for a webpage, and my job is to bring it to life using HTML and CSS. It's pretty exciting stuff!

## What am I building?

I'm creating a whole webpage from scratch! It's got all the works - a snazzy header, an eye-catching hero section, some info boxes, a fancy quote, a call-to-action that'll make you want to click, and a footer to wrap it all up. The challenge is to make it look as close to the design as possible, without losing my mind over every pixel.


## What will I learn?

By the time I'm done with this project, I'll have leveled up in a bunch of areas:

- Wrangling HTML to create a solid structure
- Styling with CSS to make things look pretty
- Using Flexbox to keep everything in line (literally)
- Playing with fonts and colors like a pro
- Building some basic but cool UI elements
- Getting friendly with Git and GitHub
- Launching my creation into the world with GitHub Pages
- Problem-solving (because let's face it, there will be hurdles)
- Paying attention to the little details that make a big difference

This project is my chance to show off what I've learned so far and create something I can be proud of. It's going to be a fun ride, and I can't wait to see how it turns out!
